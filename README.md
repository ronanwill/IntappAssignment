How to read the scripts in order

Step 1: The Analysis Scripts
  - Analysis_Script.py
  - Format_Analysis_Script
The above scripts are unnessary to most, I used the time to get re-familiarized with python and datframes.

Step 2: Transform_Scripts directory
  - These script were used to transform the data files into mosre usable, readable and storable format.
  - Each source data file has it's own transform script

Step 3: Target_Table_Scripts directory
  - Each of these script were used to join/merge the data into storable and flexible use

Step 4: Final_Tables directory
  - These are excel files of the the final tables.
